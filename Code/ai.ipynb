By providing a textual summary that includes the proportions of each semantic class, we give the LLM a structured reference to help it maintain a more consistent scoring standard across images. At the same time, street-view photos can suffer from occlusion, camera distance, and angle issues, so the text description alone may not fully reflect the real scene. Therefore, we also input the original image, allowing the model to adjust its judgments based on what it actually “sees.”"
